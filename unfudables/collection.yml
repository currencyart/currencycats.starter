# Unfudables is a collection inspired by Unemployables by able.com.
# The Bored Ape character was selected for its market domination
#  while the collection title was chosen
# to represent the fortitude of the non-fungible token community
# for its unwillingness to concede defeat regardless
# of scams, hacks, rugs, and market capitulation.
#
# Original BAYC traits were designed in 24 pixel format
# and programatically composed to generate 7500 unique combinations.
