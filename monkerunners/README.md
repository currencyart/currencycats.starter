Breaking News - Monkerunner Project Lead Is A Crypto Bro Fraudster - Wen Rug Pull? BagHODLers Together Strong**](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYPunkArt/comments/vmhvpk/breaking_news_monkerunner_project_lead_is_a/):

  a reminder - selling worthless jpegs that anyone can download & copy (hint: right-click & save) also known as "non-fungible" token are a crypto bros scammers' paradise.

 As the latest case study let's point out the red flags on the 6666 monkeyrunner trending (SOLD OUT!) token sale:

   Who's the artist?  Would you buy art if you do not know the artist's name & bio (life story)?     We don't know. Red flag? 

   By the way, the artist is the computer a.k.a. CGI - the bitmap is a computer-generated imagery (CGI) in 2D 50x50 pixels. 

   Where's the artist from? Or let's state the obvious - where's the crypto bro fraudster from?  We don't know. Red flag?

  Let's read-up on the fraudster in its own words:

> so wen monke fell into lava new monke appear that were special... a game is being developed with a nice bounty prize at the end... currently the contract is paused... it will open at some point.  you will be able to mint again.  it will have changed to make way

   Clearly to put together the fraud requires intelligence and we can assume the crypto fraudster knows excatly what he's doing (that is, getting-rich-quick by selling token to greater fools).  For another case study of "self-declared doxxed - and - thus, honest fraudsters", see [**Crypto Bro Fraudster Case Study - The Jeremy & Florian's ® Expansion Punks - Jeremy Posvar (Microsoft) & Florian Uhde (IBM) - Raking In Millions of Free Money In The Name Of Inclusion & Diversity & Female Empowerment**](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYPunkArt/comments/vel2xg/crypto_bro_fraudster_case_study_the_jeremy/).

   Anyways, back to the writing -  sounds like a English-as-a-second-language speaker -  welcome to wonders of the internets - world wide fraud at your fingertips.

It's endless pump & dump fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) hustling 
and even criminal market manipulation by burning the token of "owners" that list (try to flip / resell) below the "suggested" .02 [ETH] minimum price of the "decentralized" collection.  


What's your take? What am I missing or not seeing? What red flags do you look for or see? Any commentary on the pixel art?  Any inside  news on the (serial?) crypto bro fraudster?  Is rug pulling the new normal?  Wen MonkeFest® with Snopp Dogg® & Eminem®? Wen MonkeBurger®?
